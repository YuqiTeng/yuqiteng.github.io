Instead of loading fonts from local fonts library, fonts can also be provided by online fonts service.

Today I want to recommend the <b>Google Fonts API</b>.

### Main Steps

1. Choose the fonts you like from <b>Google Fonts</b>. 
2. Add the fonts to your own collection. 
3. Get the script codes from Google Fonts.

After adding the codes to your website you will be possible to add the font families to your CSS styles. However, it should be noted that <i><b>adding too many font styles can slow down your webpage</b></i>.<br> 

### Tips
1. Sometimes the fonts server can be blocked in certain countries.
2. Choose detailed fonts style to reduce loading time.
